# Todo

- Dev textures on everything, mixed with arbitrary colors
- Fix colors (current brightness discrepancy will make fog of war harder to differentiate in some parts of the map)
- Billboards for health, player names, etc..
- Efficient Navmesh and navigation
- Efficient collision checking and resolution
- Efficient 3D camera raycast into 2D physics engine using height checking (use max-height to reduce how far you have to cast ray from)
- Player control
- Fundamental damage and movement systems
- Vision checking logic + shader for visual indication
- Entity spawning: minions, AA projectiles, skillshots
- Damage types, stats
- Networking!?!?
- Sound!?!?
- Art, Animation
